# Global Project Rules

These rules must be followed at all times to ensure the project remains world-class, maintainable, and optimized. These rules reflect the standards of top global software companies and 20+ years of fullstack engineering experience.

---

## 1. Documentation Discipline
- **Before and after every code or project action, review all relevant documentation** (especially: `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `Docs/CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/README.md`, and others).
- **Immediately update documentation** to reflect any changes, decisions, or progress. No action is complete until docs are current.
- **Track progress and decisions** in `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `Docs/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Keep `Docs/README.md` accurate** for onboarding and status.

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability
- **No redundant, dead, or unused code.** Every file, function, and class must have a clear, necessary purpose.
- **Remove obsolete code immediately**—do not leave TODOs or commented-out code in production branches.
- **Every piece of code must be justified**—if its purpose is unclear, document it or remove it.
- **Follow strict linting, formatting, and typing rules** (enforced by CI and pre-commit hooks).
- **Use modular, single-responsibility design**—each module does one thing well.
- **Write clear, concise docstrings and comments only where needed.**

## 3. Industry Best Practices
- **Use the best, proven industry standards** for architecture, security, testing, and deployment.
- **Prioritize maintainability and future-proofing**—design so that features can be added or changed without major refactoring.
- **Test all core logic thoroughly**—unit and integration tests are mandatory for business logic.
- **All configuration and secrets must be externalized** (never hardcoded).
- **Automate quality checks** (linting, type checking, tests) via CI/CD.

## 4. Progress and Change Management
- **Every change must be tracked in the relevant doc(s).**
- **Major decisions, architectural changes, or deviations from plan must be logged in `Docs/CONTEXT.md`.**
- **Mark completed steps in `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** as soon as they are done.
- **If new requirements or blockers are discovered, update all affected docs immediately.**

## 5. Collaboration and Professionalism
- **Communicate clearly and proactively**—leave helpful notes for future contributors.
- **Follow contribution guidelines and code of conduct.**
- **Review PRs for adherence to these rules—do not approve code that violates them.**

---

**These rules are non-negotiable. The goal is a clean, robust, maintainable, and scalable codebase that never needs a major refactor.**
