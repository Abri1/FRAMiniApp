### [2025-05-01] Telegram Bot Integration Completed
**Context:**
- Comprehensive Telegram Bot integration implemented with full webhook support, command handling, and error management
- Created modular command structure in `/src/bot/commands/` with handlers for all required commands
- Implemented webhook handling in `/src/api/webhook.ts` for receiving updates from Telegram API
- Added detailed inline documentation and robust error handling throughout
- All code follows project principles: modularity, error handling, logging, and type safety

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Integrate Telegram Bot API (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- Current implementation depends on Supabase methods that are not fully implemented yet (createAlert, getAlertsByUserId, getAlertById, deleteAlert)
- These will need to be properly implemented when completing the Supabase integration task

**Resolutions/Notes:**
- All command handlers are fully implemented and ready for integration with database layer
- Webhook setup and update processing is complete and ready for HTTP server integration

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Implement Supabase integration to provide the database access methods required by the bot commands
- [ ] Create HTTP server implementation to host the webhook endpoint
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for Telegram bot functionality
- [ ] Consider adding command rate limiting and user authentication for premium features

### 2025-05-02: Supabase Integration Progress
- **Progress:** Supabase integration partially completed. Schema defined in `src/db/schema.ts`, initial migration script applied to project `gdebzwtwlrbhjyxcddvc` with tables for users and alerts, performance indexes, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Existing methods in `src/integrations/supabase.ts` support Telegram bot commands. Configuration updated to use environment variables for Supabase URL and anonymous key to enhance security.
- **Blockers:** Full Supabase Auth setup with JWT and linking Telegram user IDs to Supabase user records is pending. Testing of database operations and RLS policies is also required.
- **Decisions:** Proceed with Supabase as the database backend due to its ease of use, PostgreSQL foundation, and built-in auth features. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration data to adhere to security best practices.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Complete Supabase Auth configuration to link Telegram user IDs using JWT.
  2. Test database operations and RLS policies to ensure security and functionality.
  3. Update documentation with any additional schema changes or migration needs.
  4. Move to HTTP server setup for webhook handling after Supabase integration is fully tested.

### 2025-05-03: Finalized Supabase Access and Authentication Model
- **Progress:** RLS policies updated in Supabase to restrict all access to the `service_role` only for `users` and `alerts` tables. The backend uses the Supabase service key for all DB operations. All user identity and access control is managed via Telegram ID in the `users` table. No Supabase Auth, email, or JWTs are used. This model is secure, simple, and fully aligned with project requirements and global rules.
- **Blockers:** None. This approach is now canonical for user management and security.
- **Decisions:** All bot/database operations use the service key, never the anon key. No user ever directly queries Supabase; all access is through the backend/bot. RLS policies ensure only the backend can access data.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Ensure all backend code uses the Supabase service key for DB operations.
  2. Continue with webhook/HTTP server setup and further feature development.
  3. Maintain documentation and security best practices as the project evolves.

### 2025-05-03: Telegram Bot /start Command User Check Integration
- **Progress:** Successfully updated the `/start` command handler in `src/bot/commands/start.ts` to check if a user exists in Supabase using `getUserByTelegramId` and create a new user with `createUser` if not found. This ensures that users are registered in the database upon first interaction with the bot. Linter errors with `sendTelegramMessage` function calls have been resolved by using a single object argument with `chat_id` and `text` properties.
- **Blockers:** None at this time regarding the `/start` command integration.
- **Decisions:** Proceed with documenting the successful integration and continue with other aspects of Supabase integration.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Complete Supabase Auth configuration to link Telegram user IDs using JWT.
  2. Test database operations and RLS policies to ensure security and functionality.
  3. Update documentation with any additional schema changes or migration needs.
  4. Move to HTTP server setup for webhook handling after Supabase integration is fully tested.

### 2025-05-03: Centralized Error Handling & Logging Completed
- **Progress:** All modules now use the centralized logger in `src/logger/` (Winston-based). No direct console logging remains. Errors are normalized, logged consistently, and actionable. Logging is modular, type-safe, and environment-aware. Fully compliant with global rules.
- **Blockers:** None.
- **Decisions:** Proceed to Sentry (or similar) integration for error monitoring as the next step in `implementation.md`.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Integrate Sentry (or similar) for error monitoring and alerting.
  2. Continue with health checks and further monitoring improvements.

### 2025-05-03: Axiom Integration for Error Monitoring Completed
- **Progress:** Integrated Axiom for error monitoring and log forwarding. All logs are forwarded to Axiom if AXIOM_TOKEN and AXIOM_DATASET are set in the environment. No sensitive data is logged. Fully compliant with global rules and project requirements.
- **Blockers:** None.
- **Decisions:** Proceed to health checks for all services as the next step in `implementation.md`.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Implement health check endpoints for each service and set up uptime monitoring.
  2. Continue with further monitoring and operational improvements.

### 2025-05-03: Health Check Endpoints Implemented
- **Progress:** Health check endpoints implemented. Express HTTP server added in `src/index.ts` with `/health` and `/telegram/webhook` endpoints. `/health` returns status of the app, DB, and Telegram integration. Structure is modular and extensible for future checks (Polygon.io, Twilio, etc.). Centralized logging is used throughout.
- **Blockers:** None.
- **Decisions:** Current health check covers app, DB, and Telegram. Ready to extend for other integrations as needed.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Continue with the next item in `implementation.md` (deployment, CI/CD, or other operational improvements).

### [2025-05-04] Final Webhook Logic Removal – Polling-Only Mode Complete
**Context:**
- Deleted `src/api/webhook.js` as the final step in removing all webhook logic and endpoints from the codebase.
- The project is now fully polling-only for Telegram updates; no webhook code or files remain.
- This ensures strict compliance with global rules: no dead code, full modularity, and clear separation of concerns.

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Migrate to polling-only mode (remove webhooks) (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- None. Manual deletion was required due to permissions.

**Resolutions/Notes:**
- Codebase and documentation are now fully in sync. All webhook logic is removed, and the system is robust, maintainable, and production-ready.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with CI/CD, security, and further improvements as outlined in `implementation.md`.

### [2025-05-04] User Onboarding and Main Menu Flow Finalized
**Context:**
- Defined and documented the canonical user onboarding and main menu flow for the Telegram bot.
- On /start, the system checks if the user exists in Supabase. If not, greets by username, introduces the bot, and prompts for phone number (with validation and storage). After phone is received, sends an info message and shows the persistent main menu.
- The main menu (reply keyboard) always shows: Set Alert, View Alerts, Credits, Info.
- Set Alert guides the user step-by-step (pair, price, direction, confirm, save).
- View Alerts shows all alerts as cards with edit/delete buttons.
- Credits shows current balance and purchase instructions.
- Info sends a detailed usage guide.
- All input is validated, errors are clear, and all flows are modular and testable.

**Related Tasks:**
- [ ] Telegram Bot User Onboarding & Main Menu Flow (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- None at this time. Awaiting implementation of the new flows.

**Resolutions/Notes:**
- This is now the canonical onboarding and interaction flow for the bot. All future development should follow this structure and update documentation as needed.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the onboarding and menu flows in code.
- Update Supabase schema if needed (phone, credits).
- Write tests for all new flows and edge cases.
- Continue to update documentation and checklist as implementation progresses.

### [2025-05-04] Onboarding Flow Modules Scaffolded

- Implement phone number update in Supabase.
- Continue with alert creation, view alerts, credits, and info flows.

### [2025-05-04] Set Alert and View Alerts Flows Scaffolded
**Context:**
- The Set Alert and View Alerts flows are now scaffolded and implemented in code.
- Set Alert guides the user step-by-step through pair, price, direction, confirmation, and creates alerts in Supabase.
- View Alerts fetches all alerts for the user and displays each as a Telegram message (card).
- Both flows are modular, type-safe, and ready for further extension (e.g., inline edit/delete, advanced validation).

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Set Alert Flow (see `implementation.md`)
- [x] View Alerts (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- Inline keyboard support for edit/delete and advanced validation are TODOs.

**Resolutions/Notes:**

- Add inline keyboard support for alert cards.
- Integrate all flows into the bot handler.
- Test all flows and update documentation as you proceed.

### [2025-05-04] All Main User Flows Integrated in Bot Router
**Context:**
- All four main user flows (Set Alert, View Alerts, Credits, Info) are now scaffolded and integrated into the main bot message router.
- The router handles menu button presses, commands, and in-progress flows (e.g., Set Alert step-by-step).
- The codebase is modular, type-safe, and ready for further extension.

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Set Alert Flow (see `implementation.md`)
- [x] View Alerts (see `implementation.md`)
- [x] Credits (see `implementation.md`)
- [x] Info (see `implementation.md`)
- [x] Main Bot Router (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- Inline keyboard support for alert cards and edit/delete handlers are TODOs.

**Resolutions/Notes:**
- All main user flows are now accessible from the menu and commands. The system is ready for user testing and further feature development.

**Next Steps:**
- Add inline keyboard support for alert cards (edit/delete).
- Implement edit/delete alert handlers.
- Test all flows and update documentation as you proceed.

### [2025-05-04] Edit/Delete Alert Flows Fully Integrated
**Context:**
- Alert edit and delete flows are now fully implemented and integrated with the callback query handler.
- Users can edit and delete alerts directly from the Telegram UI using inline buttons on alert cards.
- Edit flow prompts for a new price and updates the alert; Delete flow removes the alert and notifies the user.
- All flows are modular, type-safe, and ready for user testing.

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Edit/Delete Alert Flows (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- None. Ready for user testing and further validation.

**Next Steps:**
- Test all flows end-to-end.
- Add advanced validation and error handling.
- Update documentation as needed.

### [2024-06-09] Onboarding Robustness Fix
- **Problem:** Users could get stuck in onboarding if the bot was restarted or if the in-memory onboarding state was lost. Entering a valid phone number after a restart did nothing.
- **Decision:** Remove dependency on in-memory onboarding state. Always check the database for onboarding status. For any non-command message, if the user is not onboarded, treat the message as a phone number and attempt onboarding.
- **Outcome:** Users can now always complete onboarding by sending their phone number, regardless of bot restarts or previous state. This makes the onboarding flow robust and user-friendly.

### [2024-06-10] UI & Routing Clean-up
**Context:**
- The onboarding, command, and menu routing was refactored to improve maintainability and user experience.
- All text messages now flow through a single `processMessage` function, removing fragile FSM state.
- Menu buttons (`Set Alert`, `View Alerts`, `Credits`, `Info`) are explicitly handled, eliminating slash commands in user interactions.
- Onboarding logic was simplified to detect phone numbers directly and avoid redundant database calls.
- The info guide (`showInfo`) was reformatted to be more friendly with whitespace and button labels.
- The persistent main menu (`showMainMenu`) no longer displays a header text, using a zero-width space for a cleaner UI.
- Console logs were cleaned up to only show level and message for readability.

**Next Steps:**
- Test all menu flows end-to-end to ensure no regressions.
- Update tests to cover new routing and UI changes.
- Consider additional UX enhancements (e.g., inline keyboards, toast notifications).

### [2025-05-04] Refactor: Main Menu Now Shown With No Prompt, Just Keyboard
**Context:**
- The main menu was fully refactored to match best practices from tp-caller. The menu is now always shown as a persistent keyboard with no prompt or explanatory message—just the keyboard itself. This provides a clean, self-explanatory UI and avoids any unprofessional or redundant messages.
- All flows now invoke showMainMenu with no message argument, and the menu logic is centralized and maintainable.

**Related Tasks:**
- [ ] Persistent Main Menu (Reply Keyboard) (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- None. All usages were updated and tested.

**Resolutions/Notes:**
- The menu is now always visible, clean, and professional. No empty, invisible, or redundant messages are sent.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to review all user-facing flows for similar UX improvements.

### [2025-05-04] Finalized: Menu Keyboard for Onboarded Users Only
**Context:**
- The persistent menu keyboard is now always shown for onboarded users only, using the exported mainMenuKeyboard constant from menu.ts.
- All flows and commands check onboarding status before attaching the menu, ensuring only users who have completed onboarding see the menu.
- This approach is robust, professional, and matches best practices (see tp-caller reference).
- No empty or invisible messages are sent, and the UI is clean and self-explanatory.

**Related Tasks:**
- [x] Persistent Main Menu (Reply Keyboard) (see `implementation.md`)

**Problems/Blockers:**
- None. Solution is tested and confirmed working.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for any edge cases or user feedback.
