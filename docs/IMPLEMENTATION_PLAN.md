# Implementation Plan

## Deployment Readiness Cleanup (2025-05-03)
- [x] Remove Express API server (Twilio webhook endpoint)
- [x] Remove all code and DB fields related to call_sid and call_status
- [x] Apply DB migration to drop these columns
- [x] Update documentation to reflect this simplification
- [x] Confirm all notification logic is handled in the main bot process
- [x] Update Twilio call flow: Calls now use a TwiML <Redirect> to a /api/twilio/play-message endpoint, ensuring the message only plays after the call is answered. This prevents users from missing the start of the message if they answer late.
- [x] Add /api/twilio/play-message endpoint to serve the message TwiML after answer.
- [ ] Final review for any lingering references or comments
- [ ] Update onboarding and deployment docs for new, simpler architecture
