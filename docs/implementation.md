# Implementation Checklist – Forex Price Alert SaaS Telegram Bot

> **Project Principles:**
> - All code and architecture must be modular, maintainable, robust, and highly optimized from the start.
> - Apply separation of concerns: isolate business logic, integrations, and utilities into well-defined modules.
> - Use clear interfaces and dependency injection to enable easy testing and extensibility.
> - Avoid code duplication and tightly coupled components.
> - Document all modules, APIs, and core logic for maintainability and onboarding.
> - Write clean, consistent, and idiomatic TypeScript with strict linting and formatting.
> - Favor composition over inheritance and keep functions and modules small and focused.
> - Ensure all parts of the system can be independently tested and replaced without breaking the rest.
> - Optimize for performance and resource efficiency, especially in hot paths (e.g., alert evaluation, WebSocket handling).
> - Design with future scalability and new features in mind so that refactoring is not required later.

This is a living document to track every implementation task for the project. Each task has a checkbox, description, and a notes line for progress updates. Update this document as you work through the project.

**Folder Explanations:**
- `src/core/`: Pure business logic, no direct dependencies on integrations or frameworks.
- `src/services/`: Encapsulates system-level services (notification queue, alert processor, monitoring, etc.).
- `src/integrations/`: Dedicated modules for each third-party API. No business logic—just API communication.
- `src/jobs/`: All background/scheduled jobs, registered and scheduled in one place.
- `src/api/`: REST/GraphQL endpoints or webhooks, thin controllers only.
- `src/bot/`: Telegram bot command routing, parsing, and user interaction logic.
- `src/db/`: Database access, migrations, schema definitions, abstracted behind interfaces.
- `src/utils/`: Pure, stateless helpers, no side effects.
- `src/types/`: All shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and enums.
- `src/config/`: Load, validate, and export configuration (env, constants, feature flags).
- `src/logger/`: Centralized logging setup, all modules use this for logging.
- `src/middlewares/`: HTTP middlewares (rate limiting, auth, error handling), if needed.
- `tests/`: All test suites, mirroring the source structure for coverage.
- `scripts/`: DevOps, migration, and utility scripts.
- `docs/`: All documentation, including planning, edge cases, and architecture.

This structure enforces separation of concerns, clear interfaces, and ease of extensibility, making the project robust and easy to maintain as it grows.

---
_Context: Initialize a new Git repository for version control, add a .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files, create a README for project overview, and establish the standard directory structure including /src for source code, /docs for documentation, and /tests for automated testing. This is foundational for a maintainable and collaborative codebase._  
Notes:

- [x] **Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript**  
_Context: `npm init -y` run, TypeScript installed as dev dependency, and `tsconfig.json` generated with strict settings._
Notes: Completed 2025-04-30.

_Context: Design the PostgreSQL schema in Supabase, including tables for users, alerts, credit_transactions (for the credit system), and audit_logs (for traceability). Migrate the schema using Supabase migrations. Keep schema modular and normalized for maintainability and extensibility. This forms the backbone of the data model._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies**  
_Context: Write and enforce Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own data. Test RLS rules thoroughly to prevent data leaks or privilege escalation. This is essential for security and compliance._  
Notes:

## 3. Polygon.io Integration

- [ ] **Fetch and cache forex pairs from Polygon.io REST API**  
_Context: On service startup and every 6 hours, call the Polygon.io REST API to fetch the latest list of valid forex pairs, normalize the data, and cache it in memory for fast validation of user input. This ensures only supported pairs are used for alerts._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Implement persistent WebSocket connection to Polygon.io**  
_Context: Establish and maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to Polygon.io at `wss://socket.polygon.io/forex`. Subscribe to all pairs with active alerts, handle reconnections with exponential backoff, and monitor connection health. This is the core real-time data pipeline for alerting._

Notes:

- [ ] **Handle Polygon.io outages and rate limits**  
_Context: Monitor for Polygon.io outages or rate limiting, buffer missed updates, retry with backoff, and notify the admin if persistent. Always respect Polygon.io API usage policies to avoid service disruption._  
Notes:

---

## 4. Telegram Bot

_Context: Register the Telegram bot, configure a secure HTTPS webhook for receiving updates, and securely document/store the bot token. This enables user interaction and alert management._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Implement command handling (/start, /addalert, /listalerts, /removealert, /credits, /settings)**  
_Context: Implement all required Telegram bot commands, validate user input for each, and provide clear, actionable feedback. This is critical for user experience and system reliability._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Link Telegram users to Supabase users**  
_Context: Ensure that each Telegram user is uniquely identified and mapped to their Supabase user record using their Telegram user ID. This links bot actions to the correct user data._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Input validation and normalization**  
_Context: Rigorously validate all user input for alerts—check forex pair against the cached list, ensure price is numeric and reasonable, direction is valid, and prevent duplicate alerts per user/pair/price/direction._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Error handling and user feedback**  
_Context: Implement robust error handling for all Telegram interactions, covering all documented edge cases, and always return informative, actionable error messages to users._  
Notes:

---

## 5. Alert Logic & Processing

- [ ] **Create alert CRUD endpoints/services**  
_Context: Build backend endpoints/services for creating, updating, deleting, and listing alerts, ensuring all operations are secure, validated, and efficient.

Notes:

- [ ] **Efficient alert evaluation on price updates**  
_Context: On each price update, efficiently evaluate all relevant alerts, batch process triggers, and minimize database reads/writes for scalability._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Atomic alert triggering and credit deduction**  
_Context: Use database transactions to ensure that alert triggering and credit deduction happen atomically, preventing race conditions and double-processing._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Prevent duplicate and spurious triggers**  
_Context: Ensure alert triggers are idempotent—each alert can only be triggered once, and is marked as triggered in the database to prevent duplicate notifications._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Automate alert cleanup and expired alert handling**  
_Context: Implement scheduled jobs to automatically clean up expired or triggered alerts, keeping the database tidy and efficient._  
Notes:

---

## 6. Twilio Voice Integration

Notes:

- [ ] **Implement per-user and global rate limiting for calls**  
_Context: Implement per-user and global rate limiting for Twilio calls to prevent abuse and control costs, and monitor call usage for anomalies._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Webhook for call status and retries**  
_Context: Use Twilio webhooks to track call status, automatically retry failed calls up to a safe limit, log all attempts, and notify admin if failures persist. This ensures reliable voice alert delivery._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Credit deduction and fallback to Telegram if no credits**  
_Context: If a user does not have enough credits or a Twilio call fails, automatically notify the user via Telegram and log the event for admin review._  
Notes:

---

## 7. Notification & Job Queue

- [ ] **Set up job queue (e.g., BullMQ/Redis) for notifications**  
_Context: Set up a job queue (e.g., BullMQ/Redis) to decouple real-time alert evaluation from notification delivery, improving system resilience and scalability._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Implement retry, backoff, and dead-letter queue**  
_Context: Implement retry logic, backoff strategies, and a dead-letter queue for failed notifications or calls, ensuring no alert is lost and failures are traceable._  
Notes:

- [ ] **Monitor queue health and autoscale workers**  
_Context: Monitor the health and size of the job queue, autoscale workers if needed, and alert the admin if the queue grows beyond safe thresholds._  
Notes:

---

## 8. Monitoring, Logging & Automation

Notes:

---

## 9. Security & Compliance

- [ ] **Enforce environment variable and secret management**
