# Implementation Checklist – Forex Price Alert SaaS Telegram Bot

> **Project Principles:**
> - All code and architecture must be modular, maintainable, robust, and highly optimized from the start.
> - Apply separation of concerns: isolate business logic, integrations, and utilities into well-defined modules.
> - Use clear interfaces and dependency injection to enable easy testing and extensibility.
> - Avoid code duplication and tightly coupled components.
> - Document all modules, APIs, and core logic for maintainability and onboarding.
> - Write clean, consistent, and idiomatic TypeScript with strict linting and formatting.
> - Favor composition over inheritance and keep functions and modules small and focused.
> - Ensure all parts of the system can be independently tested and replaced without breaking the rest.
> - Optimize for performance and resource efficiency, especially in hot paths (e.g., alert evaluation, WebSocket handling).
> - Design with future scalability and new features in mind so that refactoring is not required later.

This is a living document to track every implementation task for the project. Each task has a checkbox, description, and a notes line for progress updates. Update this document as you work through the project.

## 2a. Telegram Bot User Onboarding & Main Menu Flow

- [x] **User Onboarding via /start**
  _Context: When a user sends /start, the system checks if they exist in Supabase (by Telegram user ID)._
  - If not, greet the user by their Telegram username and welcome them to the bot.
  - Send a brief introduction to the bot and its purpose.
  - Prompt the user to provide their phone number in international format (preferably via Telegram's contact sharing button).
  - On phone number receipt, validate (E.164/international format) and (TODO) store it in Supabase.
  - Send an info message explaining what the bot does and how to use it.
  - (TODO) Show the persistent main menu (see below).
  - If the user already exists, greet them and (TODO) show the main menu immediately.
  - **Status:** `/start` command handler and onboarding flow modules scaffolded. Phone number validation and info message logic implemented. Integration points for phone number storage and main menu display are marked as TODOs. Next: implement main menu, Supabase update, and further flows.

- [ ] **Persistent Main Menu (Reply Keyboard)**
  _Context: After onboarding, and at all times, the user sees a reply keyboard with:_
  - Set Alert
  - View Alerts
  - Credits
  - Info
  _Context: After onboarding, and at all times, the user sees a reply keyboard with:_
  - Set Alert
  - View Alerts
  - Credits
  - Info
  - **Refactor (2025-05-04):** The menu logic was finalized: the persistent menu keyboard is now always shown for onboarded users only, using the exported mainMenuKeyboard constant from menu.ts. All flows and commands check onboarding status before attaching the menu. This approach is robust, professional, and matches best practices. See context.md for rationale and details.

- [x] **Set Alert Flow**
  _Context: Guides the user through creating a new alert._
  1. Select forex pair (list or validated text entry).
  2. Enter target price.
  3. Choose direction (above/below).
  4. Confirm alert details.
  5. Save alert to Supabase and confirm to user.
  - **Status:** Flow is scaffolded and implemented. Guides user step-by-step, validates input, and creates alerts in Supabase. Modular, type-safe, and ready for further extension (e.g., persistent state, advanced validation, duplicate/credit checks). Integrated into main bot router.

- [x] **View Alerts**
  _Context: Shows all user alerts as individual cards/messages._
  - Each alert card displays details and (TODO) will have Edit/Delete inline buttons.
  - **Status:** Flow is scaffolded and implemented. Fetches all alerts for the user and displays each as a Telegram message. Modular, type-safe, and ready for further extension (e.g., inline keyboard, edit/delete handlers). Integrated into main bot router.

- [x] **Credits**
  _Context: Shows the user's current credit balance._
  - If user wants to purchase more, instruct to contact @abribooysen.
  - **Status:** Flow is scaffolded and implemented. Fetches and displays user credits, with purchase instructions. Integrated into main bot router.

- [x] **Info**
  _Context: Sends a detailed guide on how the bot works, how to set/manage alerts, how credits work, and how to get support._
  - **Status:** Flow is scaffolded and implemented. Sends a detailed user guide. Integrated into main bot router.

- [x] **Main Bot Router**
  _Context: Routes menu button presses, commands, and in-progress flows to the correct handler._
  - **Status:** All main user flows are integrated. Modular, type-safe, and ready for further extension. Next: add inline keyboard support for alert cards, implement edit/delete handlers, and test all flows.

- [ ] **Validation & Error Handling**
  - All user input (phone, pair, price, etc.) is validated.
  - Clear, actionable error messages for invalid input or edge cases.

- [ ] **Testing**
  - Comprehensive tests for onboarding, menu, alert flows, and error scenarios.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - This flow is cross-referenced in `context.md` and adheres to global rules.

- [x] **Edit/Delete Alert Flows**
  _Context: Users can edit or delete alerts directly from the Telegram UI using inline buttons on alert cards._
  - Edit and Delete flows are fully implemented and integrated with the callback query handler.
  - Edit flow prompts for a new price and updates the alert; Delete flow removes the alert and notifies the user.
  - All flows are modular, type-safe, and ready for user testing.
  - **Status:** Complete. Next: test all flows, add advanced validation, and update documentation as needed.

## [2024-06-09] Onboarding Robustness Fix
- The onboarding flow now always checks the database for onboarding status.
- For any non-command message, if the user is not onboarded, the bot attempts to treat the message as a phone number and run onboarding.
- This removes dependency on in-memory onboarding state, making onboarding robust to bot restarts and user errors.
- Users can now always complete onboarding by sending their phone number, even if the bot was restarted or onboarding state was lost.

## [2024-06-10] UI & Routing Clean-up
- Unified update routing: all text messages are now handled by `processMessage`, removing the FSM-based onboarding state.
- Added explicit menu button handling for `Set Alert`, `View Alerts`, `Credits`, and `Info`—no slash commands in guide text.
- Simplified onboarding logic: direct phone-number detection, removed duplicate database lookups and FSM helper.
- Refactored `showInfo`: redesigned guide with improved whitespace, button references, and separated from menu display.
- Updated `showMainMenu`: removed visible header text (`Main menu:`), using an invisible placeholder for a clean UI.
- Enhanced logging: console transport logs only level and message (no timestamps), while Axiom transport remains unchanged.

## 3. Error Handling & Monitoring

- [x] **Centralized error handling and logging**  
_Context: Implement error normalization and logging via `src/logger/`. Ensure all modules use this for error and event logging._
Notes: Completed 2025-05-03. All modules now use the centralized logger in `src/logger/` (Winston-based). No direct console logging remains. Errors are normalized, logged consistently, and actionable. Logging is modular, type-safe, and environment-aware. Fully compliant with global rules.

- [x] **Integrate Sentry (or similar) for error monitoring**  
_Context: Set up Sentry integration, configure alert rules, and ensure sensitive data is scrubbed from logs._
Notes: Completed 2025-05-03. Integrated Axiom for error monitoring and log forwarding. All logs are forwarded to Axiom if AXIOM_TOKEN and AXIOM_DATASET are set in the environment. No sensitive data is logged. See README and .env.example for setup instructions.

- [x] **Health checks for all services**  
_Context: Implement health check endpoints for each service and set up uptime monitoring._
Notes: Completed 2025-05-03. Express HTTP server added in `src/index.ts` with `/health` and `/telegram/webhook` endpoints. `/health` returns status of the app, DB, and Telegram integration. Structure is modular and extensible for future checks (Polygon.io, Twilio, etc.). Centralized logging is used throughout.
